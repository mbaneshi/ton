The code you provided is a C++ header file that defines a class `AdnlStaticNodesManager` within the `ton::adnl` namespace. Let's break down the key components of the code:

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "td/actor/actor.h"
#include "td/utils/Status.h"
#include "td/actor/PromiseFuture.h"
#include "auto/tl/ton_api.h"

#include "adnl-peer-table.h"

namespace ton {

namespace adnl {

class AdnlStaticNodesManager : public td::actor::Actor {
 public:
  virtual void add_node(AdnlNode node) = 0;
  virtual void del_node(AdnlNodeIdShort id) = 0;
  virtual td::Result<AdnlNode> get_node(AdnlNodeIdShort id) = 0;

  static td::actor::ActorOwn<AdnlStaticNodesManager> create();
};

}  // namespace adnl

}  // namespace ton
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `#pragma once`: This is a preprocessor directive that ensures the header file is included only once in a compilation unit. It helps prevent multiple inclusions and potential issues related to multiple definitions.

- `#include` statements: These include necessary header files from the TD (Telegram Database) library, such as actor system headers (`actor.h`), utility headers (`Status.h`), promise and future headers (`PromiseFuture.h`), and Telegram API headers (`ton_api.h`). Additionally, there's an inclusion of `"adnl-peer-table.h"`.

- `namespace ton { namespace adnl { ... } }`: This code is inside nested namespaces. The `AdnlStaticNodesManager` class is defined within the `adnl` namespace, which itself is within the `ton` namespace.

- `class AdnlStaticNodesManager : public td::actor::Actor { ... };`: This declares a class named `AdnlStaticNodesManager` that inherits from `td::actor::Actor`. This implies that `AdnlStaticNodesManager` is an actor, which is a concurrency primitive often used in the TD library.

- `public` section: The public section of the class declares three virtual functions: `add_node`, `del_node`, and `get_node`. These functions are expected to be implemented by derived classes. The `add_node` function takes an `AdnlNode` parameter, the `del_node` function takes an `AdnlNodeIdShort` parameter, and the `get_node` function returns a `td::Result<AdnlNode>` and takes an `AdnlNodeIdShort` parameter.

- `static td::actor::ActorOwn<AdnlStaticNodesManager> create();`: This is a static member function that returns an instance of `AdnlStaticNodesManager` wrapped in a `td::actor::ActorOwn`. The purpose of this function is to create an instance of the `AdnlStaticNodesManager` class.

Overall, this code appears to be part of the implementation of a static nodes manager in the Telegram Database library, specifically within the `adnl` namespace. The manager is expected to handle the addition, deletion, and retrieval of static nodes.
