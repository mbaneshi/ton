# adnl-address-list
It looks like you've provided C++ code related to the Telegram Open Network (TON) library, specifically the Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL). This code defines classes and functions related to ADNL addresses and address lists.

Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. **AdnlAddressImpl Class:**
   - Abstract base class for ADNL addresses.
   - Contains virtual functions for getting the hash, checking if the address is public, getting the serialized size, and creating a network connection.
   - Provides a static method `create` for creating an `AdnlAddressImpl` object from a TL (Type Language) object.

2. **AdnlAddress Class:**
   - A typedef for `td::Ref<AdnlAddressImpl>`.
   - Represents a reference-counted ADNL address.

3. **AdnlAddressList Class:**
   - Represents a list of ADNL addresses.
   - Contains information such as version, reinitialization date, priority, expiration date, and a list of ADNL addresses.
   - Provides methods for accessing and modifying these properties.
   - Includes functions for serialization and deserialization using TL.

4. **Namespace `adnl`:**
   - Contains the `Adnl` and `AdnlNetworkManager` classes (not provided in the code snippet).

5. **Namespace `ton`:**
   - Encloses the `adnl` namespace.

This code seems to be part of a larger project related to the Telegram Open Network, specifically focusing on the ADNL layer for network communication.

If you have specific questions about certain parts of the code or if you need assistance with something specific, feel free to ask!

***

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the provided C++ code and explore the purpose and functionality of each component.

### 1. `AdnlAddressImpl` Class:

The `AdnlAddressImpl` class is an abstract base class representing ADNL addresses. Here are the key aspects:

- **Purpose:**
  - It serves as the base class for various types of ADNL addresses.
  - Provides a common interface for different address types.

- **Member Functions:**
  - `get_hash()`: Returns the hash of the address.
  - `is_public()`: Checks if the address is public.
  - `serialized_size()`: Computes the serialized size of the address.
  - `tl()`: Returns a TL (Type Language) object representing the address.
  - `create_connection(...)`: Creates an ADNL network connection.

- **is_reverse():**
  - Checks whether the address is a reverse address. By default, it returns false.

- **Static Method `create`:**
  - Creates an `AdnlAddressImpl` object from a TL object.

### 2. `AdnlAddress` Typedef:

- It is a typedef for `td::Ref<AdnlAddressImpl>`.
- Represents a reference-counted ADNL address.

### 3. `AdnlAddressList` Class:

The `AdnlAddressList` class manages a list of ADNL addresses. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **Purpose:**
  - Represents a list of ADNL addresses bundled together.
  - Provides methods for managing and manipulating the list.

- **Members:**
  - `version_`, `reinit_date_`, `priority_`, `expire_at_`: Metadata associated with the address list.
  - `addrs_`: A vector containing `AdnlAddress` objects.
  - `has_reverse_`: Indicates whether the address list has a reverse address.

- **Methods:**
  - `empty()`: Checks if the address list is empty.
  - `add_addr(...)`: Adds an ADNL address to the list.
  - `update(...)`: Updates the address list with a new IP address.
  - `public_only()`: Checks if the list contains only public addresses.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of addresses in the list.
  - `serialized_size()`: Computes the serialized size of the address list.
  - `tl()`: Returns a TL object representing the address list.
  - `add_udp_address(...)`: Adds a UDP address to the list.
  - `set_reverse(...)`, `has_reverse()`: Manages reverse address information.

- **Static Method `create`:**
  - Creates an `AdnlAddressList` object from a TL object.

### 4. Namespaces `adnl` and `ton`:

- `adnl`: Contains classes related to the Abstract Datagram Network Layer.
- `ton`: Encloses the `adnl` namespace within the larger Telegram Open Network context.

### Summary:

The provided code is an integral part of the ADNL layer in the Telegram Open Network. It defines classes for managing ADNL addresses and address lists, providing a flexible and extensible architecture for handling different types of addresses and managing lists of these addresses efficiently. This is crucial for the network communication layer of the Telegram Open Network, ensuring proper connectivity and communication between nodes. The use of TL objects facilitates serialization and deserialization of these address structures.
