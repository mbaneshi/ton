This code appears to be a part of the TON Blockchain Library, and it defines some inline functions for streaming various types to a `StringBuilder` in the `td` namespace. Let's go through each part:

1. **License Information:**
   ```cpp

   This section provides information about the licensing terms under which the TON Blockchain Library is distributed. It mentions that it is free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

2. **Header Inclusions:**
   ```cpp
   #include "ton-types.h"
   #include "td/utils/base64.h"
   ```
   This file includes headers for types related to TON blockchain (`ton-types.h`) and a utility library for base64 encoding (`td/utils/base64.h`).

3. **Namespace:**
   ```cpp
   namespace td {
   ```
   The code is within the `td` namespace.

4. **Streaming Operators Overloads:**
   The code overloads the `<<` operator for streaming various TON-specific types to a `StringBuilder`. This is commonly done to facilitate easy logging or debugging.

   - `operator<<(td::StringBuilder &stream, const ton::Bits256 &x)`: Overloaded for streaming `ton::Bits256`.
   - `operator<<(td::StringBuilder &stream, const ton::ShardIdFull &x)`: Overloaded for streaming `ton::ShardIdFull`.
   - `operator<<(td::StringBuilder &stream, const ton::AccountIdPrefixFull &x)`: Overloaded for streaming `ton::AccountIdPrefixFull`.
   - `operator<<(td::StringBuilder &stream, const ton::BlockId &x)`: Overloaded for streaming `ton::BlockId`.
   - `operator<<(td::StringBuilder &stream, const ton::BlockIdExt &x)`: Overloaded for streaming `ton::BlockIdExt`.

5. **Streaming Implementation:**
   The implementations of these streaming operators use `StringBuilder` to construct a string representation of the respective TON types.

6. **Namespace Closing:**
   ```cpp
   }  // namespace td
   ```
   Closes the `td` namespace.

These functions are likely used for logging or debugging purposes, allowing easy conversion of TON-specific types to strings for output. If you have specific questions or need more details about a particular aspect, feel free to ask!
