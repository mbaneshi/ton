The provided code appears to be part of the TON Blockchain Library, specifically related to the Virtual Machine (VM) functionality. Let's break down the key components of this code:

1. **License Information:**
   - The code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This license allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, but it imposes some restrictions to ensure that any modifications made to the code remain open-source.

2. **Header Guard:**
   - `#pragma once` is a header guard that ensures the contents of the header file are included only once during compilation.

3. **Included Headers:**
   - The code includes several headers, such as "common/refcnt.hpp," "vm/cells.h," and "td/utils/Context.h." These headers likely contain necessary declarations and definitions for the classes and functions used in this code.

4. **Namespace:**
   - The code is within the `vm` namespace, and it uses the `td` namespace for some types.

5. **Class Declaration:**
   - The class `VmStateInterface` is declared, which inherits from `td::Context<VmStateInterface>`. It is an abstract class that serves as an interface for the VM state.

6. **Public Interface:**
   - The public section of the class declares several virtual functions that subclasses must implement:
      - `load_library`: Loads a library identified by a hash and returns a `Cell`. It may throw a dictionary exception and returns `nullptr` if the library is not found.
      - `register_cell_load`: Registers the loading of a cell with a given hash.
      - `register_cell_create`: Registers the creation of a cell.
      - `register_new_cell`: Registers a newly created cell.
      - `register_op`: Registers an operation, and it can specify the number of operation units. Returns a boolean indicating success.

7. **Comments:**
   - There are comments providing information about each function and the purpose of the code blocks.

8. **Using Statements:**
   - The code uses the `using td::Ref;` statement to bring the `Ref` type into the `vm` namespace.

Overall, this code defines an abstract interface for the VM state in the TON Blockchain Library, specifying functions that subclasses must implement to handle various aspects of the VM's behavior, such as loading libraries and registering cell operations.

Certainly! Let's break down the key concepts related to the `VmStateInterface` class in the provided code:

### Class Declaration:

```cpp
class VmStateInterface : public td::Context<VmStateInterface> {
 public:
  virtual ~VmStateInterface() = default;
  virtual Ref<Cell> load_library(td::ConstBitPtr hash) = 0;
  virtual void register_cell_load(const CellHash& cell_hash) = 0;
  virtual void register_cell_create() = 0;
  virtual void register_new_cell(Ref<DataCell>& cell) = 0;
  virtual bool register_op(int op_units = 1) = 0;
};
```

#### 1. Class Name and Inheritance:

- **Class Name:** `VmStateInterface`
- **Inheritance:** It inherits publicly from `td::Context<VmStateInterface>`. This means that `VmStateInterface` is a subclass of `td::Context<VmStateInterface>`, inheriting its members and behavior.

#### 2. Virtual Destructor:

```cpp
virtual ~VmStateInterface() = default;
```

- **Purpose:** The `virtual ~VmStateInterface()` declares a virtual destructor. A virtual destructor is used to ensure that the proper destructors of derived classes are called when an object is deleted through a pointer to the base class.

- **`= default;`:** The `= default;` syntax indicates that the default destructor implementation provided by the compiler should be used.

#### 3. Pure Virtual Functions:

```cpp
virtual Ref<Cell> load_library(td::ConstBitPtr hash) = 0;
virtual void register_cell_load(const CellHash& cell_hash) = 0;
virtual void register_cell_create() = 0;
virtual void register_new_cell(Ref<DataCell>& cell) = 0;
virtual bool register_op(int op_units = 1) = 0;
```

- **Purpose:** These are pure virtual functions, indicated by the `= 0` at the end. A pure virtual function is a function declared in a base class but not defined there. It must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) derived class.

- **Function Signatures:**
  - `load_library`: Loads a library identified by a hash and returns a `Cell`.
  - `register_cell_load`: Registers the loading of a cell with a given hash.
  - `register_cell_create`: Registers the creation of a cell.
  - `register_new_cell`: Registers a newly created cell.
  - `register_op`: Registers an operation, and it can specify the number of operation units. Returns a boolean indicating success.

#### 4. `td::Context`:

```cpp
public td::Context<VmStateInterface>
```

- **Inheritance Usage:** The inheritance from `td::Context<VmStateInterface>` suggests that `VmStateInterface` is designed to be used within a context managed by the `td::Context` template class. The specifics of how the context is used depend on the implementation details of the `td::Context` template.

### Summary:

In summary, `VmStateInterface` is an abstract class that defines an interface for managing the state of a virtual machine (`vm`). It provides a set of pure virtual functions that any concrete class implementing this interface must define. The class is designed to work within a context managed by the `td::Context` template. The specific implementation details for these functions would be provided by subclasses that inherit from `VmStateInterface`.
