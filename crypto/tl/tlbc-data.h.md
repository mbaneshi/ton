This C++ code appears to be part of the TON Blockchain Library, which is a blockchain focused on high transaction throughput. The code defines various structures and functions related to type expressions, constructors, fields, and types.

Let's break down some key elements:

1. **License Information:**
   - The file starts with license information, indicating that the TON Blockchain Library is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

2. **Namespace and Includes:**
   - The code is within the `tlbc` namespace.
   - It includes necessary headers like `<string>`, `<vector>`, and a custom header `"common/linalloc.hpp"`.

3. **Type Expressions:**
   - `TypeExpr` represents expressions related to types. It has various attributes like `tp` (expression type), `value`, `type_applied`, etc.
   - The `TypeExpr` structure supports different types of expressions, such as integers, tuples, references, and conditional types.

4. **Structs and Enums:**
   - There are structs like `Field`, representing fields with associated information.
   - Enums like `te_Unknown` and `te_Type` define constants related to type expressions.

5. **Constructors:**
   - The `Constructor` struct represents constructors with information such as names, tags, fields, and parameters.

6. **Types:**
   - The `Type` struct represents types, including information about constructors, arity, determinism, and constraints.
   - Types have associated constructors, and the code seems to handle aspects like determinism, size, and bit prefixes.

7. **Functions:**
   - Various functions are defined, such as `check_mode`, `bind_value`, `compute_size`, `compute_any_bits`, etc.
   - These functions perform operations related to type expressions and constructors.

8. **Global Variables:**
   - Some global variables like `const_type_expr` and `types` are declared, presumably holding constant type expressions and types, respectively.

9. **Symbol Values:**
   - `SymVal` and `SymValType` are used for representing symbol values and symbol types.

10. **Other Information:**
   - The code uses namespaces like `src` and `sym`.
   - There are comments providing information about the purpose of certain sections.

In summary, this code defines a set of structures and functions to handle type expressions, constructors, fields, and types in the context of the TON Blockchain Library. It appears to be a critical part of the library's implementation for managing types and their associated expressions.
